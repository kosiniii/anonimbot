A bot that works with libraries such as aiogram, telethon, redis for the database and postgresql, the entire functionality of the bot is the creation of a private group using the telegram api and adding users there, in the future, if I'm not lazy, I plan to make a site for anonymous chatting.
There are commands /start /find /stop
Middleware logic for processing users whether they are subscribed to the channel or not, also automatic saving of database sessions and debugging of the list of active users in case of errors.
