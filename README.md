## Command description
### /start

When this command is sent, the user is added to the database (user_id, username) and immediately sent to register for entering (gender, nickname) the nickname is needed to display users in the chat, i.e. if the user enters a nickname, then this nickname will be used in the future (anonymity method), gender is needed for advertising integrations if necessary.

### /admin

This command is entered exclusively by the administrator specified in the .env file. This command also has functions for counting the number of rooms, and counting users who will be added to the search.

### /find

When a user enters this command, he starts searching for an interlocutor and is automatically added to redis and the active_users DB, the search for an interlocutor also occurs in this DB (randomly). After two users have found each other, they are sent an invitation to join a private chat. If one of the interlocutors does not enter the chat, the link to the invitation is deleted and the chat is deleted in the same way.

### /stop

Removing a user from the redis active_users database.
=======
A bot that works with libraries such as aiogram, telethon, redis for the database and postgresql, the entire functionality of the bot is the creation of a private group using the telegram api and adding users there, in the future, if I'm not lazy, I plan to make a site for anonymous chatting.
There are commands /start /find /stop
Middleware logic for processing users whether they are subscribed to the channel or not, also automatic saving of database sessions and debugging of the list of active users in case of errors.
